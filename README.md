# YOLO Segmentation for RoboCup Humanoid Soccer League
This repository trains a YOLO segmentation model on a custom dataset used in the RoboCup Humanoid Soccer League and converts it to ONNX format, enabling real-time deployment for robotic vision and segmentation tasks.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to train a segmentation model suitable for the RoboCup Humanoid Soccer League, leveraging the YOLO architecture. By converting the trained model to ONNX format, we ensure compatibility with a wide range of deployment environments.
